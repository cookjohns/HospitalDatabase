Please branch before making changes. It would be great if we could keep all code change discussion contained within github's pull request messaging system. 

If you don't know how all of this works, it's really easy. Without going into detailed instructions, just branch the repo, make your changes to your branch, then when you're ready submit a pull request. That will allow us to see and discuss the proposed changes, and merge them into the master branch when we're all good.
