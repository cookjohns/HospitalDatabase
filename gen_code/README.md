This is my work so far on some generation code. We can choose another language.
Because of a personal project I am working on, I choose to do some initial
mockups in Node.js (Javascript). This code is not total functional, but is close
to functional. This is manly a test of branching and also so you all can
see some examples of Node.js code to contribute to the discussion of what
language to go with.
